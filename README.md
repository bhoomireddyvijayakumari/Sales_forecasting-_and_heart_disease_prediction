# Sales_forecasting-_and_heart_disease_prediction

##1. Time Series Forecasting: Sales Prediction

Using a daily sales dataset, I explored ARIMA and SARIMA models to forecast future values. After testing traditional models, I implemented:

- Log-transformed SARIMA for variance stabilization
  
- Exponential Smoothing (ETS) and EWMA to capture trend and handle volatility
  
- Evaluated models with RMSE, MAPE, and SMAPE
  
- Visualized historical vs predicted sales to assess model performance
  
##2. Logistic Regression: Heart Disease Classification

I also built a logistic regression model to classify patients based on features like age, cholesterol, BP, and smoking status.

Key steps included:

- Data cleaning & encoding categorical variables

- Feature scaling using StandardScaler

- Model training and evaluation with confusion matrix & classification report

- Visual insights using seaborn to explore age, cholesterol, and BP distributions by disease status.

Both projects were done in Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Seaborn)
